This was the orignal "proof of concept" app I was using to check out different OSC libraries
and ensure that they could talk to Eos. As such it serves no use now, but I'm keeping it just in case.

It's also quite handy for diagnostics becasuse I know it works so I can rule out whether it is the
program or some configuration issue on Eos.
